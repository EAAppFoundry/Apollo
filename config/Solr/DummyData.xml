  <field name="description">
    Modify the AWK web services to add a new method that accepts an array of CIDs and returns the mID and dID for items that match.
    Write tests for this new method.
    Include those tests into the CI build
    Modify the GGG adapter to:
    Get a list of reels and materialIDs for that CID
    Call this new service with the CID
    If it returns all of the segments, then do not send a file. Mark the work as complete and log that it was skipped.
    Otherwise send the file


    Questions:
    Should we be sending xml for versions past a certain date?
    How can we identify if something is ingested? Instance.d_id?
    What happens if it is partially ingested?
    What happens if the segments are ingested but under a different d_ID?
  </field>
